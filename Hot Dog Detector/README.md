# Hot-Dog-Detector

Here is some TensorFlow code where I used a pretrained convolutional neural
network, and a fully connected artifical neural network to find images of hot
dogs. This jupyter notebook is based on a TensorFlow tutorial on classifying
different types of flowers, but it has been modified so that it can run on
python 3.
