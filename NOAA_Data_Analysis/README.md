# NOAA Data Analysis

<p align = 'justify'>
This repository contains an assignment from class that involves performing data analysis using MySQL. Our task was to analyze a small subset of the vast database collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This database contains temperature data from multiple weather stations around the world from 1824 to 2017. For more information about the assignment, feel free to look the MySQL_Assignment.pdf file. The queries used to perform the data analysis are at the MySQL_Assignment.sql file.
